# coding-events

add a Person class to the app to store
ID
Name
email
password
get ID, getter and setter for Name, email, password
constructor and empty constructor

secondary class  PersonDetails to store details like hometown, age, languages, etc. has a one-to-one 
  relationship with Person

Person would have a many-to-many relationship with Event class

the purpose of the app is to allow people to create events and mark themselves as attending or not so
  they can plan a schedule around different events
  
currently the app will allow users to create events and display them, but not register as users or save 
  listed events to an itenerary
  
future implementation to consider would be allowing users to register and save the different events to
  a schedule of their design and maybe cross reference those schedules with other users
